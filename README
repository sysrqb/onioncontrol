This is currently a half-baked controller for a Tor client.

Running:

  $ cargo build

should just-work. It assumes the controller cookie is located at
`/run/tor/control.authcookie`. It uses COOKIE authentication, so use this at
your own risk. It assumes there is a UNIX Domain socket at `/run/tor/control`.

If either of these files are not readable by the user running this program,
then either switch users or run it as root. Again, as stated above, "This is
currently a half-baked controller" and "use this at your own risk". This is how
I use it, but I wrote it.

It currently supports:
  - subscribing to events emitted by tor
  - sending a signal to tor
  - sending a CLOSESTREAM and CLOSECIRCUIT
